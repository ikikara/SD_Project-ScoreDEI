## Notes important to read
- For more information about the project, end-points and links read the Report
- The function "edit-team" doesn't work properly
- When run for the first time can give some errors, in this case delete 5th line of application.properties file and change the field on 8th line to *create* instead of *update*. Then for 2nd and following runs change to the original configurations
